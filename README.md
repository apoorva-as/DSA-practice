# DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Structure
- *array/* â†’ Array-based problems  
- *linklist/* â†’ Linked List problems  
- *slidingwindow/* â†’ Sliding Window problems  
- *string/* â†’ String problems  
- Sorting algorithms (bubblesort.cpp, quicksort.cpp, etc.)

## Goal
I will be solving at least one DSA problem every day and pushing it here ðŸš€

## How to Run
Compile using g++:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
